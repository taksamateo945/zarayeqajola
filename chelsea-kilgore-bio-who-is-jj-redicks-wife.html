He was still on the journey to proving that he was good enough for the NBA.</p><p>The lovebirds started dating the same year they met, got engaged in July 2009, and on the 26th of June 2010, they tied the knot. It was like a script from the movies and perhaps, the beautiful part about it is that the couple has remained married ever since.
