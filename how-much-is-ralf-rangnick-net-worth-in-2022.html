Ralf was signed by his previous club Ulm 1846 in 1997, and in his first season, he won the Regionalliga S√ºd.</p><p>He was later employed by Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, where he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2000 before being ejected in 2001.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-ralf-rangnick-net-worth-in-2022nbsp>How Much Is Ralf Rangnick Net Worth In 2022?</h2><p>Ralf Rangnick has a net worth of $9-10 million, which is primarily derived from his successful coaching career. His coaching work and attitude have garnered him tremendous recognition in Germany, and he has been a source of reference for many coaches around the world for more than three decades.</p><p>Ralf was one of the first coaches to public football techniques, most notably during a December 1998 ZDF SportsStudio TV show. As a result, he earned the moniker ‚Äúprofessor,‚Äù which was first used to mock him but has since come to mean respect.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>üß† Inside the mind of Ralf Rangnick‚Ä¶</p><p>‚ñ™ Thoughts behind our formation<br>‚ñ™ Two 'perfect' players for the system<br>‚ñ™ How we recovered possession<a href=#>#MUFC</a> | <a href=#>#MUNCRY</a></p><p>‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) <a href=#>December 5, 2021</a></p><p>He started his coaching career in the 1980s, first as a player-coach at Viktoria Backnang in his hometown, then as a player and coach for VfB Stuttgart II and TSV Lippoldsweiler.</p><p>Rangnick assumed control of VfB Stuttgart for the remaining five games of the 1998‚Äì99 season on May 3, 1999, and the club finished 11th.
