They have been in a romantic relationship since late 2019 after they met on the set of the Disney movie that year.</strong></p><p>Donnelly got her break-out role as Taylor Otto in ABC’s hit comedy, American Housewife from 2016 to 2021 and since then, her personal life has been a topic of interest to her fans. She has also been romantically linked to various individuals over the last few years, and those links have formed the central reason for this article that explores her past relationships, and current romantic relationship with Noah Zulfikar.</p><h2><strong>Meg Donnelly’s Boyfriend Is Canadian Actor Noah Zulfikar</strong></h2><p>Almost as soon as Meg Donnelly and her boyfriend, Noah Zulfikar, went public with their relationship in December 2019, fans of the actress began to seek out authentic information about the actor who also shared a screen with the actress in the movie Z-O-M-B-I-E-S 2.</p><p>Before we further explore the nuances of Donnelly’s romantic relationship with Zulfikar, a brief overview of the actor’s identity will not be a misplaced endeavor. Meg Donnelly’s boyfriend, Noah Zulfikar, was born on January 11, 2000, in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, a piece of information that confirms his status as a Canadian citizen.</p><p>He spent his early life with his parents and an older sister named Shaila Zulfikar. Not much is known about the actor’s father who recently passed on on May 15, 2021, but we can confirm that his mother’s name is Erlyn Zulfikar.</p><p>So far, the details of his formal educational background are a mystery but he comes across as suitably educated, although it is quite challenging to determine the extent of his academic qualifications without enough information.</p><h2><strong>Meg Donnelly And Noah Zulfikar Met And Started Dating On The Set Of Z-O-M-B-I-E-S 2</strong></h2><p>More than a couple of reliable sources close to the couple have ascertained the fact that Meg Donnelly and her current boyfriend Noah Zulfikar met on the set of Z-O-M-B-I-E-S 2 in 2019.</p><p>While the fact that their romantic relationship blossomed from having to spend a lot of time together on set is not a novelty, it does not make it any less romantic that things played out for them the way they did.</p><p>At first, the couple played the cards of their then-relatively new relationship close to their chests but on July 25, 2019, Zulfikar sent tongues wagging with an Instagram birthday picture post that featured him alongside the beautiful actress.</p><p>The fact that the post did not carry a lot of words gave nothing away about their relationship, and all the media and the general public could do was speculate. However, the American Housewife actress made their relationship public on August 18, 2019, after she posted a cute picture of herself in the warm embrace of the actor, and captioned it with a heart emoji.</p><h3><strong>Noah Zulfikar’s Showbiz Career Goes Beyond Acting</strong></h3><p>Noah Zulfikar’s acting career appears to be gaining a significant amount of momentum following his appearances in movies and TV series such as The Next Step (2017 – 2020), Dance Together (2019), Meg Donnelly: Impress (2020), and of course Z-O-M-B-I-E-S 2 (2020), amongst others.</p><p>However, it is important to reiterate the fact that his involvement in showbiz goes beyond being an actor. According to several close sources, Meg Donnelly’s boyfriend is also a dancer who has been dancing since he was seven years old and joined the Canadian Dancing Company where he was represented by the Stars Academy Talent Agency.</p><p>In addition to having appeared as a dancer in several music videos, Noah Zulfikar is also a model whose physique and personality have landed him more than a few modeling gigs which he has executed to perfection.</p><h2><strong>The Couple Has Been Quite Open About Their Relationship</strong></h2><p>Before revealing the state of their relationship, fans of Meg had speculated that she was dating another co-star (more on that later), and a few of those were disappointed when she eventually revealed Noah as her boyfriend. It’s been more than three years since Donnelly made the post that confirmed her status as the Canadian actor’s girlfriend, and the couple appears to be going from strength to strength.</p><p>They have been quite open with the love and affection they shower on each other by posting pictures of them together across their social media handles as well as taking out time to celebrate each other on their special days, including birthdays.</p><p>The relationship has had its fair share of controversy. One of them was when the couple went nearly a year without posting about each other, leading to speculations about them going splitsville. To the best of our knowledge though, the couple is still together, and their social media apathy towards each other could be because they are both busy with work projects.</p><p>So far though, Donnelly and Zulfikar’s only time together on set and screen has come in the second installment of the Disney Channel movie where they were each quite professional and did not allow their then-budding romantic feelings toward each other to affect their job as actors.</p><h3><strong>Meg Donnelly Was Romantically Linked To Another Z-O-M-B-I-E-S Co-Star, Milo Manheim</strong></h3><p>A little while before Zulfikar came along, fans of the Zombies movie series were actively “shipping” the actress and another of her Zombies co-stars – Milo Manheim. A few even went as far as stating that the pair were already a couple because of the closeness they exhibited on and off the screen.</p><p>While the pair did not specifically go out of their way to deny or confirm the rumors, their rather platonic mannerisms toward each other and Donnelly’s confirmation of her romantic ties to Noah Zulfikar eventually poured cold water on all those speculations.</p><h3><strong>There Were Rumors Of Relationships Between Donnelly And Two Of Her American Housewife Co-Stars</strong></h3><p>An uninformed observer might conclude that Meg Donnelly has a thing for male actors she shares the silver screen with because of her relationship history which includes being romantically linked to two of her co-stars on the set of American Housewife.</p><p>The stars who were touted as Meg Donnelly’s love interests are Peyton Meyer and Logan Pepper. The rumored relationship with Meyer was fueled by the excellent screen chemistry between the pair who portrayed on-screen lovers Trip and Taylor. However, nothing came of it.</p><p>The details of her romantic link to Logan Pepper were more intense but neither came out to deny or confirm the rumors, and so it died a natural death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmallZx6pbvNp5ylpKmoeqO72J%2Bpop2emXqiuMtmmJunpal6qbHRZqeaq6Riv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxv4yapZ1llJbBqrrGZqOinpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./audrey-dalton-19340121-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Audrey Dalton (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./candy-spellings-house-2011146.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Candy Spelling Sells $150 Million Mansion to Heiress, 22</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
