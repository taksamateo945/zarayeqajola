Skyler Banks (with Tameka Kute), Angelo Banks (with Nicole Covone), Willow Banks (with India Royale), Du’mier Banks (Mother unknown), and Bella Banks are his other five siblings (with Nicole Covone). Durk’s upbringing was riddled with misdemeanors. He was involved in stealing and violence. His father was likewise engaged in criminal activity in Chicago. Lil’s father had abandoned him. His father left him when he was just seven months old. Durk had been thinking about creating a satisfying life for the people he cared about. Durk’s second kid is Zayden. He has always given his all to provide for his children and wants them to have everything he did not have as a youngster.</p><p>Lil does not want his children to be associated with the streets or criminality. He has also said that he wishes for his children to be intelligent. Zayden wants kids to read books, play games, and participate in sports. He doesn’t want kids to know anything about gangs or life on the streets. Lil has also said that he wishes for his children to live outside Chicago.

As a result, he is sentenced to three months in jail. He was let free, but he did not change. This resulted in additional 87-day imprisonment for him. His deeds did not end there.
