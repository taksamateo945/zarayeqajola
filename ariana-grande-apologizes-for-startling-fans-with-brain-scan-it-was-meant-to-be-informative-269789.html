She used Instagram Stories on Friday to share her intention was to be informative, as well as encouraging, not scary.</p><p>“Didn’t mean to startle anyone with my brain thingy. It just blew me away. I found it informative and interesting and wanted to encourage ya’ll to make sure you check on your brains listen to your bodies take care of yourselves too,” Grande began the critical message to her followers.</p><p>https://twitter.com/arianaaccesscom/status/1116446563407151104</p><p>On Thursday, the pop star set off alarm bells when she shared a <a href=#>photo of a healthy brain, then one of her brain</a>. The singer is suffering from PSTD, from the deadly terrorist attack that took place after her Manchester concert in 2017. Grande’s over 150 million followers were immediately alarmed and startled at her post, worried for the singer’s health.</p><p>“I love science and seeing the physical reality of what’s going on in there was incredible to me. I mean, I feel it all the time, but seeing it is totally different and super cool. Someday, when I’m feeling ready or when I’m more healed up, we can talk more about it. I am constantly working on my health learning how to process pain (aren’t we all). Every day is different, but I’m doing my best,” she continued.</p><p>Grande shared the highly talked about photos two days before she is set to take the stage at the infamous Coachella Festival. The timing also had her fans freaking out, wondering if there was not something more severe wrong with the singer and questioned if she would make her much hyped about appearance.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwIQOmClt69/</p><p>“Just know I will continue showing up and giving as much of my energy as I can and do my best even tho my brain looks like the world map. (That’s why her hair’s so big, it’s full of trauma…k ariana, log off) Love u,” the 25-year-old ended her lengthily story.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Ariana Grande is letting her fans know she didn’t mean to startle them with her brain scan post. She does have PTSD. However, the message Grande intended for her fans was that of encouraging them to take care of their body and minds. It definitely backfired on her and alarmed her followers, but thankfully she has set the record straight.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRp7aiusBmnquZnpmybq3PqKOon5mvsrR5xaipZquklr%2B1uMinnmaekaPAbsPIrZ9mmqKWtq950pyYp2WZqXq4rdJmpJ6Znql6tbuMm5xmoZ6bvLO5wK2gr51dZ4N6g5dyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-shows-off-27-million-house-app-tyga-mugshot-20151010.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Shows Off $2.7 Million House on App, Has Tyga's Mugshot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10116438-nfl-rumors-daniel-jones-health-a-real-concern-amid-injury-giants-mara-favors-qb.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NFL Rumors: Daniel Jones' Health a 'Real Concern' amid Injury; Giants' Mara Favors QB | News, Scores</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
