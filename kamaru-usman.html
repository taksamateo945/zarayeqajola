He was born in this world on the 11th of May 1987 to a middle-class family in a small town called Auchi.</p><p>After spending eight years of his life in average living conditions, his father brought him and his entire family to the US.</p><p>However, things didn’t become smooth so quickly. As a kid with poor English and black descent, Usman’s fellow classmen often teased and bullied him. He used to play football during his sophomore year.</p><p>Still, a significant injury led him to find an alternative path in wrestling and, later down the road, a career in MMA.</p><p>Both MMA and wrestling came to him in the same way, and he had eventually blown up without his knowledge.</p><h2>Kamaru is Married to His Wife Eleslie Dietzsch</h2><p><a href=#>Kamaru Usman</a> has been married to Eleslie Dietzsch for over a few years now. After dating her in 2012, they have been on a steady path in their relationship.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-3278 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kamaru-USMAN-Eleslie-Dietzsch.jpg alt="Image of professional MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN and his wife" width=564 height=492 sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-3278 class=wp-caption-text>A professional MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN, and his wife, Eleslie Dietzsch.</p><p>In an interview back in 2016, he revealed that Eleslie was his girlfriend, and now, in 2021, they tied the knot and have a beautiful daughter aged 7.</p><p>Being an incredibly private person, he hasn’t shared much of his love life in the masses. But rest assured, the two seem to have a very fulfilling life with each other.</p><h2>Who is Kamaru Usman Wife Eleslie Dietzsch?</h2><p>Kamaru Usman’s baby momma and wife Eleslie Dietzsch has not much written about her. Even as the wife, she has no feature on her husband’s wiki.</p><p>However, we can tell you that Eleslie is of Portuguese nationality and Brazilian descent.</p><p>She is five years older than Usman, making her 38 years old in 2021, and celebrates her birthday on the 23rd of November 1986.</p><p>Additionally, Eleslie seems to have two sisters and her father and mother altogether in her side of the family.</p><h2>Eleslie Dietzsch Social Media Activities</h2><p>Eleslie Dietzsch is available on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with a following of 1009 as of today. Alongside this, she also runs her daughter’s Instagram with her husband and posts pictures of the family doing various activities.</p><p>She actively posts on her Instagram account as well. The latest post is on the 11th of June as I am writing this article.</p><p>Her Instagram bio states,</p><p>“Her vibe was completely her own…</p><p>…She reminded me of no one.”</p><h2>Samirah Usman: Daughter of Kamaru Usman</h2><p>Unlike her mother and father, baby Samirah likes to enjoy her spotlight. Born in 2014, she is the only daughter of Kamaru and Eleslie.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-3277 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kamaru-with-his-wife-and-daughter.jpg alt="Image of professional MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN and his family" width=560 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-3277 class=wp-caption-text>A renowned MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN, and his wife, Eleslie Dietzsch and his daughter, Samirah.</p><p>Samirah is a beautiful little lady who loves spending time with her parents and shares a great bond with them.

She even has her own <a href=#>Instagram</a> and a self-named <a href=#>YouTube</a> channel with about 186 subscribers.</p><p>From what we already know, the Usman family enjoys each other’s company, and we hope it stays the same way in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jqSYppmiqnq2v8yapWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10124423-nba-rumors-darius-garlands-trade-market-cooling-off-after-cavs-presidents-comments.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NBA Rumors: Darius Garland's Trade Market Cooling Off After Cavs President's Comments | News, Scores</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./without-feeling-as-a-dental-patient-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Without feeling as a dental patient</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
