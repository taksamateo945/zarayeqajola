He is well known for his work on the hood film series, which started with Kidulthood in 2006, and Doctor Who for the BBC.</p><h2>Allegations leveled against Noel Clarke</h2><p>The Guardian disclosed the claims made by women who knew him professionally in April 2021. Clarke told one lady he meant to “f**k her and fire her” and covertly filmed a n**ed audition.&nbsp;Clarke, according to the former London School of Dramatic Art student, urged students to strip during improvisation lessons. After the accusations were made public, the Met said that it was conducting an investigation. Scotland Yard, on the other hand, stated on Friday that it will not begin a formal inquiry “after a comprehensive review by professional officers.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>TWENTY women accused Noel Clarke of sex offences, all seemingly wrong.

Despite concerns regarding Clarke’s personality and actions, the committee was reprimanded for bestowing the prize on him.&nbsp;Actors such as Christina Chong, who co-starred in Bulletproofs with Clarke, said that the claims against him had been “the UK film industry’s best-kept secret for years.”&nbsp;If you’re not sure, trust me when I say it’s true.”</p><p>Following the claims, Noel Clarke resigned from his production firm. Sky’s Bulletproof, in which he starred, was pulled off the schedule and canceled. Clarke’s BAFTA membership was also revoked, as was his Award for Exceptional British Contribution to Cinema, which he was awarded in April 2021.</p><h2>Noel Clarke has refuted all the allegations.</h2><p>The Doctor Who actor “vehemently” rejected “any s**ual misconduct or criminal crime” and expressed “deep remorse” that some of his activities had hurt others “in ways I did not intend or recognize.”&nbsp;Clarke stated he pondered suicide but changed his mind after speaking with his kid for the first time since the stories broke.</p><p>He stated:</p><p>“Twenty years of labor in 24 hours.” I lost everything, including the firm I established from the bottom up, my TV series, movies, book agreements, and industry recognition.
