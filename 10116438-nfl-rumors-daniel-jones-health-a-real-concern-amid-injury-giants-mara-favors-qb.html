But now he's recovering from a torn ACL that will almost certainly sideline him until training camp and might keep him out at the start of the season."</p><p>However, Vacchiano also noted team owner John Mara said, "I still have every confidence in the world in Daniel. Let's put a better team around him. Hopefully, he'll get healthy, and I think the real Daniel Jones is the one that played in 2022, particularly down the stretch in the playoffs."</p><p>To say the situation for the Giants is difficult would be an understatement.</p><p>It was just last offseason that they <a href=#>agreed</a> to a four-year, $160 million deal with Jones and placed the franchise tag on star running back Saquon Barkley. Now, Barkley is with the division-rival Philadelphia Eagles, and there are plenty of questions about New York's quarterback outlook.</p><p>Jones has been inconsistent throughout his career since the NFC East team selected him with a first-round pick in 2019. He threw for 3,027 yards, a career-best 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions as a rookie just to throw for 21 touchdowns to 17 interceptions while going 9-16 as a starter the next two seasons.</p>NFL <span class=acct>@NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Daniel.

The performance earned him the new contract, but he was just 1-5 as a starter with two touchdown passes and six interceptions before his injury in 2023.</p><p>Perhaps the Giants can use the No. 6 overall pick of the draft to either select a quarterback or trade up to land the signal-caller of their choice.</p><p>Even with Mara's public support of Jones, Vacchiano reported the owner "will not stand in the way if GM Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll 'fall in love with a quarterback' in this year's draft."</p><p>Mara even said Jones and a rookie could "compete and let the better man win."</p><p>It would certainly create quite a delicate situation given Jones' contract status, but the Giants will eventually have to figure out their long-term quarterback plan if they are going to realistically compete with the Eagles and Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuBdISMp52lZaKqurC%2B0mabmqaZmrluts6nnKxlmJqurcDHZphmqpWWuW6vzqeanqqeYq6utcNmoKeipafGbrPImqWtq12irrOtjJ%2BYr6eiqHqyrg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-apologizes-for-startling-fans-with-brain-scan-it-was-meant-to-be-informative-269789.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Grande Apologizes For Startling Fans With Brain Scan It Was Meant To Be Informative</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mayor-curry-presents-1-5b-budget-proposal-to-jacksonville-city-council.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mayor Curry presents $1.5B budget proposal to Jacksonville City Council</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
