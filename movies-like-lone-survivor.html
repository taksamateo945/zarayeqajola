In the Peter Berg-directed film, we follow Marcus Luttrell and his four Navy SEAL teammates as they go after Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, who is accountable for the deaths of twenty of their comrades. They had been told by intelligence reports that the leader was accompanied by a ten-man guard, but they soon found out that there were many more.</p><p>After a shepherd child alerts the rebels to their presence, a lethal chase ensues. The group makes a daring tactical retreat, tumbling down slopes and jumping off cliffs in a mind-boggling struggle for survival as the environment turns against them. One of the combat sequences lasts for 45 minutes, so the action is beyond an adrenaline rush. You will undoubtedly come away from the movie hungry for more suspenseful and thrilling action flicks like “Lone Survivor.”</p><h3>9th Company (2005)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/9th-Company.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=510 height=255 sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“9th Company” transports us to 1988 and into the Soviet perspective as the US-backed Mujahedeen cracked down on a collapsing Soviet force in a scenario that is less well-known from the Afghanistan War. Union recruits are sent to resupply the 9th Company of the 345 paratroopers and are tasked with securing Hill 3234. They are subjected to ongoing attacks that weaken their defences, murder their comrades in combat, and severely damage their mental health.</p><p>Recruits are shot left, right, and centre, supply convoys are ambushed, and mentally disturbed comrades rush into the open to be shot. Based on the actual events of Operation Magistral, the Russian film directed by Fedor Bondarchuk portrays a horrible story. If the horrifyingly realistic brutality in “Lone Survivor” surprised you, “9th Company” will show you a whole war front with a similar theme. The movie effectively conveys the never-ending abyss of terror and brutal brutality that characterises a war, particularly one that is losing.</p><h3>12 Strong (2018)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/12-strong-filgrab.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=512 height=256 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Green Berets rode out for revenge as the country watched in horror as the Twin Towers fell. The incredible story of the elite strike team that mounted an invasion is told in “12 Strong,” directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, and is based on the true story of the first Special Forces squad organised against the Taliban in Afghanistan following 9/11. Driven by bravery and a desire for vengeance, the twelve-person team collaborates with an Afghan warlord to use hit-and-run strategies to eliminate the enemy’s critical assets while facing a 50,000-person Mujahedeen force. While we witnessed our team heroes in “Lone Survivor” fighting desperately to survive, “12 Strong” is going to unleash a stunning and selfless offensive to take the adversary by surprise.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u66a0f8d4621cfa63d822148647f902b8><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Hilarious War Comedies That Show The Dark Humor Behind Wars</span></a><h3>13 Hours (2016)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/13-Hours.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=512 height=256 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Michael Bay’s explosive directorial of “13 Hours” narrates the true story of six former special forces contractors who decide to defend their post against attacking mobs in rebel-torn Libya in order to protect the US ambassador. Dictator Muhammad Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 as a result of US intervention in Libya. His death created a power vacuum that spread throughout the country, resulting in anarchy and an abundance of readily available weaponry on the black market. The US ambassador to Libya, who was positioned close to a CIA facility in Benghazi, was one of the targets of rebel factions that took to the streets.</p><p>Six security contractors in the CIA building decide to defend their fellow countryman when the ambassador is attacked, but they soon find themselves surrounded by a large number of adversaries. They will have to choose their conflicts carefully and walk a tightrope in order to survive because they have few resources, manpower, and no extraction in sight. The heart-pounding action in “13 Hours” will captivate viewers who were drawn to the tactical warfare components of “Lone Survivor.”</p><h3>Black Hawk Down (1997)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Hawk-Down.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=512 height=256 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Director Ridley Scott’s “Black Hawk Down,” which is based on the actual narrative of Operation Gothic Serpent, served as one of the inspirations for “Lone Survivor.” In 1993, US forces intervened in Somalia and dropped 100 men—including Rangers and special forces—into the Mogadishu market to apprehend two warlord lieutenants. The Rangers, led by Captain Mike Steele, are forced to conduct a rescue mission in the centre of enemy territory after encountering surprisingly strong opposition and the downing of two of their black hawk helicopters that were providing support.</p><p>Every area in Mogadishu becomes a battlefield, with perils waiting to be discovered. We sense the rangers’ anxiety as we follow them through the streets. And our hearts beat in time with the increasing firefight symphony as they are attacked and encircled by innumerable enemy forces. The performers in “Black Hawk Down” become fully immersed in the story, the film’s ominous atmosphere, and the film’s iconic last-stand scene elevate it to the pinnacle of contemporary military movies.</p><h3>Danger Close (2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Danger-close.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=501 height=251 sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 1966, 108 new Australian and New Zealand soldiers are sent on a seek and destroy mission into enemy territory in Vietnam. As they approach Long Tan via a rubber plantation, the group stops, trembling hands clenching the well-known steel of their guns. As they all fall to the ground, a flurry of machine gun fire rips through their lines. Major Harry Smith notices a flurry of activity in the distance and realises they are surrounded by an enemy twenty times their size. The novice troops confront a formidable foe in their house with no help on the way to rescue them.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u99ee285dea99eab0cc3c69cbce6545d1><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>9 Most Realistic Vietnam War Movies That'd Move Your Soul</span></a><p>Under the direction of Kriv Stenders, “Danger Close” tells the authentic tale of the fight of Long Tan, for which the company received heroism awards from the US and South Vietnam’s Presidential Unit Citations. It is based on a true narrative of bravery and a struggle for survival against insurmountable circumstances, much like “Lone Survivor.” One significant distinction is that the SEALs team consists of elite members of the US army, but the recruits in “Danger Close” make a heroic final stand as young men who stood up to certain death and left as men of war.</p><h3>Outpost (2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outpost-2019.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=512 height=256 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The goal of stationing US forces at Camp Keating is to cut off the Taliban’s supply routes through the area. But the camp is a very easy target because it is situated in a valley with mountains encircling it on all sides. Although the soldiers are frequently engaged in little battles with enemy fire, their commander is aware of an impending larger onslaught and makes an effort to mend fences by paying visits to the local elders. A group of 400 Taliban fighters surrounds them from the nearby hilltop and launches an attack.</p><p>The soldiers will have to use every resource available to them in order to survive—they have fewer men and are in a grave disadvantage. Its intense combat scenes, in which our heroes must battle back against overwhelming odds in a desperate attempt to save their lives, are evocative of the squad’s frantic tactical retreat in “Lone Survivor.” The film “Outpost,” directed by Rod Lurie, tells a brutal true story of command-chain carelessness that results in the deaths of valiant and devoted soldiers. You can feel the brutality of battle and the struggle for survival in the movie.</p><h3>The Covenant (2023)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Covenant-2023.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=512 height=256 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Covenant by Guy Ritchie centres on a group of troops under the command of Sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal). The group’s speciality is eliminating the Taliban’s facilities for producing and storing weapons. They employ interpreters from the Afghan National Army to obtain information. By serving in the US military, these Afghan nationals greatly increase the personal risk to themselves and their families. As a result, they are guaranteed a US visa upon completion of their service, enabling them to start over there. Ahmed (Dar Salim), their most recent interpreter, is extremely motivated to exact revenge on the Taliban because he lost family members to them. They are overpowered and ambushed during an operation.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u33817534e7bec0c5e21d3dbe0ddc4f0d><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>5 Most Realistic War Movies Ever Made</span></a><p>Sergeant Kinley is immobile due to severe injuries. Risking his life, Ahmed deftly navigates a protracted trek through the centre of hostile territory beside the wounded Sergeant. Following weeks spent traversing difficult terrain and testing his limitations, Kinley is returned to their base by Ahmed, and the injured Sergeant is transported back to his native country by air. When Kinley wakes up, she finds that Ahmed is being sought after in Afghanistan for his role in defaming the Taliban, despite never having received the promised Visa.</p><p>When the bureaucracy refuses to assist Kinsley in helping Ahmed, he decides to return and free his battle-brother. “The Covenant” is a tale of faith, tenacity, and fraternity, enhanced by the outstanding performances of Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. The film underlines the horrifying reality for those who supported the US forces after it left Afghanistan. “The Covenant” is a thought-provoking, exciting, and compelling war movie that will appeal to fans of “Lone Survivor.”</p><h3>The Siege of Jadotville (2016)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Siege-of-Jadotville.jpg alt="best war movies,military movies,movies like american sniper,movies like the outpost,movies like lone survivor netflix,best movies like lone survivor,movies like lone survivor reddit,best lone survivor movies,war movies afghanistan,movies like zero dark thirty,movies like hacksaw ridge,movies like 13 hours,movies like black hawk down,movies like shooter,movies like patriots day,seal team 8 behind enemy lines,best combat movies,movies like act of valor,code name johnny walker,best middle east war movies,american sniper similar movies,hyena road trailer,must watch military movies,modern navy movies,films like american sniper,lone survivor box office mojo,sniper type movies,modern warfare movie,iran iraq war movies list,best modern war movies 2017,modern war movies based on true story,restrepo war movies,modern military movies list,movies like the hurt locker on netflix,best modern war movies all time,best war on terror movies,lone survivor people also search for,movies like lone survivor quora,american sniper films like,war movies similar to american sniper,high tech military movies,the hurt locker war movies,zero dark thirty war movies,the road to guantnamo,lone survivor box office sales,badass military movies,top american military movies,movies similar to american sniper,movies like lone survivor,war movies like lone survivor,lone survivor movie quotes,movies like survivor,movies like lone survivor on netflix,movies like lone survivor based on true story,movies like lone survivor and american sniper,military movies like lone survivor,good movies like lone survivor,action movies like lone survivor,more movies like lone survivor,names that mean lone survivor" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While commandant Pat Quinlan and his company of 150 Irish soldiers are stationed in a precarious defensive position to protect people in the mining town of Jadotville, they are informed that “no one has attacked UN peacekeepers.” He gives his men orders to build trenches, take up defensive positions, and watchfulness.
