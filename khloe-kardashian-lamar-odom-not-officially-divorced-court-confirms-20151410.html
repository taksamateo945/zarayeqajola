The court rep tells&nbsp;<strong>Us</strong>&nbsp;that the judge has yet to sign the final judgment documents as of Oct. 14.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Kardashian, 31,&nbsp;<a href=#>first filed for divorce</a>&nbsp;in December 2013, she and Odom, 35, didn't sign the documents until this past July. As was reported by <strong>Us,</strong> it took nearly two years for both parties — <a href=#>who share a long and complex history</a> — to take the final step in completing the process.</p><p>"They saw each other when she was in Vegas," an insider told <strong>Us </strong>at the time.&nbsp;"And both signed the divorce documents together."</p><p>On Tuesday, Odom was found unconscious in his VIP suite at the Love Ranch South in Pahrump, Nev., where he checked in this past Saturday. The ranch's owner, Dennis Hof, told<strong> Us</strong>&nbsp;that two women found the former Lakers player unconscious at around 3 p.m. local time and called 911. "He said he was just trying to get away from people," Hof told <strong>Us</strong>. "So he could have some time to himself without the pressures of being who he is."</p><p>As was reported by<strong>&nbsp;Us,</strong>&nbsp;Kardashian was "inconsolable" after learning about Odom's condition and&nbsp;<a href=#>remained</a>&nbsp;by his side overnight. Sister <strong>Kim Kardashian </strong>and mom <strong>Kris Jenner </strong>are also currently with Khloe at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, where the basketball player remains in critical condition.</p><p>A source close to the Kardashians also told <strong>Us </strong>on Wednesday that Odom <a href=#>suffered several strokes</a> overnight. The same insider revealed that a significant amount of cocaine was found in his system.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Odom's rep released an exclusive statement to <strong>Us Weekly </strong>early Wednesday morning. “Family and friends are extremely concerned for Lamar,” Odom's longtime publicist and friend,<strong> Eve Sarkisyan</strong>, told Us. “Please don't listen to the false information being circulated unofficially. Please respect the family's privacy during this difficult time.”</p><p>Odom's former sister-in-law <strong>Kendall Jenner </strong><a href=#>also spoke out via social media</a> about the current situation. "Please don't go," the model tweeted from Shanghai, China, where she is currently partaking in Shanghai Fashion Week.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch the video above for more details about Odom.
