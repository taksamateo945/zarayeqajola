Kennedy, attended Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.&nbsp;Caroline Kennedy’s son went to Instagram on January 29 to publish a series of photos commemorating his life update. Schlossberg, 29, was seen with Harvard-themed cupcakes and a banner that said “Happy Graduation.”</p><p>Schlossberg, Caroline Schlossberg’s youngest and only child, graduated from Yale University in 2015 with a degree in history and a specialty in Japanese history.&nbsp;In 2017, Jack enrolled in Harvard Law School, and in 2018, he enrolled in Harvard Business School.</p><h2>Jack Schlossberg is from a prominent family.</h2><p>Jack was born as John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg in 1993 to Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg and is the youngest sibling of Rose Schlossberg and Tatiana Schlossberg.&nbsp;John Bouvier, his great grandfather on his mother’s side, inspired the name, Jack Schlossberg. Jack’s mother is a devout Catholic, while his father is a devout Jewish guy from Ukraine.&nbsp;Before enrolling at Yale University, the 29-year-old completed his schooling at Manhattan’s The Collegiate School.&nbsp;Jack co-founded the non-profit group RelightNY in middle school. The group, which was founded in 2007, provides energy-efficient light bulbs to low-income households in New York City and promotes environmental awareness.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jack-Schlossberg-2.jpg alt="Jack Schlossberg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Jack Schlossberg is a descendant of John F. Kennedy.</h2><p>After graduating from Yale with a degree in Japanese history in 2015, Jack followed in his mother’s footsteps and joined public service. During Barack Obama’s presidency, Jack resided in Japan with Caroline as the US Ambassador to Japan.&nbsp;Jack talked about his foreign experience at the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Awards. He said that he learned a great deal about Japan, but more significantly, about his own nation.</p><p>“It was something I had been taught my whole life but had never completely comprehended. I saw America as millions throughout the globe view it: a beacon of opportunity, stability, and strength in an uncertain world.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jack-Schlossberg-3.jpg alt="Jack Schlossberg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jack Schlossberg has been likened to his late uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in 1999. Jack, like his late uncle, who founded the monthly journal George, is interested in political writing. While a student, he wrote for the Yale Daily News and The Yale Herald and contributed to The New York Times, Politico, and The Washington Post.&nbsp;He is also a strong supporter of President Joe Biden. Schlossberg campaigned for his grandfather’s legacy and stated that America needs a leader like Biden “who thinks America’s finest days are still to come” in a virtual presence at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><h2>Jack Schlossberg is navigating his way through life.</h2><p>In 2017, during a live TV appearance on channel Today, Jack Schlossberg said that he had not decided on a professional path but that politics was at the top of his list. He stated:</p><p>“My family’s heritage of public service inspires me. It’s something I’m quite proud of. But I’m still trying to find my path and sort things out on my own. So keep tuned – I have no idea what I’m going to do.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmpubYsCktMuoqqyalae0bq3LpWSamp%2BqwW62zqGlZp5doLKvusSdsKxll6eur7DSqKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./phil-ivey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Phil Ivey: Poker, Age, Wife, Divorce, Net Worth!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./roberto-firmino-phone-number.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Roberto Firmino Phone Number, WhatsApp Number Contact Mobile</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
