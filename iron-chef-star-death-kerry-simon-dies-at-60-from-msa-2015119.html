"We will always remember Kerry fondly," the British TV personality wrote in his column. "He was a gentle man who will be missed greatly. He was still young and handsome at 60 years of age. He didn’t smoke or drink alcohol, preferring his favorite juices regimen."</p><p>Chicago-born Simon, who was given his rock n' roll nickname by Rolling Stone, solidified his celebrity chef status after winning a 2005 episode of Iron Chef. Also a successful restaurateur, he owned several restaurants in locations including Vegas, L.A., and Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p><p>In a 2010 interview with <a href=#>Haute Living</a>, Simon dished some details about his work ethic, explaining that he wanted every item on his menu to be amazing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"For example, chicken wings (at CatHouse). I must have spent three months developing them. I know it sounds silly but I went through so many different processes over chicken wings and it just went on and on," he said. "At the end of it all, it is all about hard work. I study everything and look at everything that is going on. I read everything from newspapers to food magazines to cookbooks. That plays the biggest role in what I do."</p><p>Simon, who grew up wanting to be a rock star, kicked off his culinary career back when <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s first wife, <strong>Ivana</strong>, tasked him with running the Plaza Hotel's Edwardian Room in the late '80s. Eventually, Simon moved on and up, working under world-renowned French chef <strong>Jean-Georges Vongerichten</strong>.</p><p>Reflecting back on his rise to the top, Simon told Haute Living in the same interview: "One thing if you look at my career through the years, I have taken a lot of gambles, some which were not so great, some that were very great. I [am a] very searching, spiritual person so there is something that happens through everything I have done, whether it has been the lowest part of my career or the highest part of my career, that has some sort of relativeness to that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCrp55isKmxxWaqrZmiYrGmrdOhZKSdoqfGbr%2FIpqanZZSesrR5wK1kb2hdm7%2BwuYymqpplYmV%2Bdn2Qcg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./king-richard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Richard III Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sister-of-bart-and-maggie-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sister of Bart and Maggie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
