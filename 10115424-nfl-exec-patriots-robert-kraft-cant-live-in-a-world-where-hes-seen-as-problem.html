According to The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Sando</a>, at least one exec isn't buying Kraft's excuses as to why New England failed to land Ridley.</p><p>"Kraft mentions the (state income) taxes, the quarterback, the player's girlfriend and then he mentioned the money," the exec said. "The reality is, if the dollar net taxes was higher in New England than in Tennessee, they would have gotten the player. It's like Kraft can't live in a world where he is looked at as the problem."</p>Andrew Callahan <span class=acct>@_AndrewCallahan</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Robert Kraft says the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Patriots?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Patriots&lt;/a> were willing to match Calvin Ridley's top offer, but Ridley's girlfriend wanted him to remain in the south. &lt;br>&lt;br>"It was made clear his girlfriend wanted to be in the south. … He didn't want to be in the northeast."&lt;br>&lt;br>Kraft acknowledged the QB… &lt;a href="https://t.co/zWhPd4rUGo">pic.twitter.com/zWhPd4rUGo&lt;/a></p><p>After parting ways with longtime head coach Bill Belichick and replacing him with Jerod Mayo, the Patriots were believed to be in store for significant roster changes.</p><p>However, their highest-priced free agent was veteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who signed an $8 million deal.</p><p>New England's lack of activity has not been viewed favorably around the league.</p><p>"The head coach came out early in the offseason and said, 'We have a lot of money to spend, and we are going to spend it,'" another exec said. "Then he had to walk the comment back. Then they lose out on the receiver after their GM says they have no speed on offense. So you have the two highest appointed people in the organization saying they are going to spend and they are going to prioritize speed, and then they do neither. What the hell?"</p><p>The Patriots have the No. 3 pick in the upcoming NFL draft, so perhaps they are waiting until then to make a big swing. Still, it will be hard for New England to bounce back from its 4-13 finish to the 2023 season without further roster improvements.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqBc4CMp52lZZWtsqR5z5qrq6GfqcBuvs6bnKusXaC%2ForLTZpqapqRiuarCxGagp2WRYsSwvsudZLCglaeybrTErGSsnZWjeqK%2FjKmpqJqcmro%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rugby-championship-2021-live-wallabies-seek-pumas-scalp-after-all-blacks-snatch-win-against-springboks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rugby Championship 2021 LIVE: Wallabies seek Pumas scalp after All Blacks snatch win against Springb</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./king-richard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Richard III Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
