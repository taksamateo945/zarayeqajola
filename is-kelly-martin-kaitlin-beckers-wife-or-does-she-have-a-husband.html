The duo got married in 2011, and their love has been going on strong ever since. They share one child together; a son.</strong></p><p>Kentucky native Kaitlin Becker is an American actress, TV host, and singer known for her work on NBC’s Sprout Network. She came to media recognition in 2019 with her role as Kaitlin in the 98 episodes of the TV Series Sunny Side Up. However, she rose to massive fame following her appearance as Meekah in the TV series, Blippi’s Treehouse. Ever since, many have been asking many questions about her, especially about her life off the screen.</p><h2><strong>Is Kaitlin Becker Married?</strong></h2><p>Yes! Kaitlin Becker is married to Kelly Martin, a New York-based educator and music tutor. Actress Kaitlin Becker proudly identifies as lesbian. It is not known actually when she started identifying as lesbian, but Becker has been very open about her sexuality ever since she came to public recognition. She is romantically attracted to women and is a member of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><h3><strong>Kaitlin Becker’s Wife, Kelly Martin, is a Music Tutor and Educator</strong></h3><p>Kaitlin Becker’s wife, Kelly Martin, is the musical director and program director at Jersey Productions Inc., Villa Hills, KY. She attended the West Chester University of Pennsylvania, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Music Teacher Education in 1999. She proceeded to obtain a Master of Arts Degree in Music History from the same university.</p><p>Kelly also has certification in Spanish 7-12, a post-baccalaureate Spanish program. Moreover, she has a New York State Permanent Music Teaching K-12 license from the New York State Education Department. Upon graduation, her career kicked off in 2007 as a choir director at Cincinnati Country Day School. She was assigned to teach upper school students from grade 9 to grade 12.</p><p>At the same time, she worked as managing musical director at Jersey Productions Inc. and as a teaching artist at Education Through Music. Kelly Martin has quite a large work portfolio. She has worked as a customer service representative at Chiquita Brands Intl., musical director at Sam Houston State University, and field office operations supervisor at US Census Bureau.</p><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, she has also worked as a vocal coach at Valley Stream Central High District and has been working as a freelance music teacher since 1997. She has, over the years, provided vocal training to hundreds of students, managed musical camps, and assisted in several musical theatre auditions.</p><h2><strong>Kaitlin Becker and Kelly Tied The Knot in 2011</strong></h2><p>As earlier stated, Kaitlin Becker and Kelly Martin have been married for over a decade now. Nothing is known about where and when they met, as well as the early beginning of their relationship, but the couple walked down the aisle in a white wedding ceremony on the 8th day of September 2001. Kelly is said to be Kaitlin’s long-term partner, which means that they dated for a long time before tying the knot.</p><p>Their wedding ceremony, which took place in New York, was a private one attended by only their family members and a few close friends. According to Becker, her family understood her feelings and accepted her the way she is, thus, they gave their full consent and support to her wedding.</p><p>Celebrating their 9th wedding anniversary in 2020, Becker shared their wedding photo on her Instagram with the caption, “One of the easiest and best decisions I ever made”. However, although they occasionally share their photos on social media, Kaitlin Becker and her wife, Kelly Martin, keep a low profile on their marital life.</p><h3><strong>They Welcomed a Son Named Everett Francis in 2017</strong></h3><p>Kaitlin Becker and her wife together share a child who is currently 6 years old. Now, one may wonder how they were able to birth a child. Kaitlin got pregnant through IVF, just as most LGBTQ+ couples do. She got pregnant in early 2017 and delivered a baby boy whom she named Everett Francis on 29th November 2017.</p><p>The couple currently resides in Queens County, New York, with their son, who they are raising together. Everett is, from time to time, seen spending time together with his parents. Meanwhile, Becker is known on social media for mostly speaking out on the problem she faces as a part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><h2><strong>Kaitlin Becker’s Age Compared To Her Wife’s</strong></h2><p>There is no record of Kelly Martin’s birth details or family history on the public scene. This makes it hard to ascertain her age, but a look at her academic records shows that she started college in 1995. If we work with the assumption that she started college at the normal time, which is 18 years, it means that she was born around 1977.</p><p>It also means that there is a 7-year age difference between Kaitlin Becker and her wife with the actress being 7 years younger. Kaitlin Becker’s personal and family life is relatively an open book. The actress was reportedly born on 14th April 1984 and is currently 39 years old. She was born in Villa Hills, Kentucky, United States of America, to her parents, who she usually posts their photos on social media.</p><p>Becker is the oldest of three siblings; she is an American citizen and has a mixed ethnic background. She follows the Christianity religion. Kaitlin completed her high school education at Beechwood High School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, in 2002. She then proceeded to North Kentucky University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Musical Theatre.</p><h2><strong>Kaitlin Becker’s Net Worth Compared To Her Wife’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Kelly Martin has had an active and thriving career as a music director and educator and has accumulated a net worth of more than a $100,000, but this is surpassed by Kaitlin Becker, with an estimated net worth of $1.1 million. Becker made her money majorly from her career as an actress. After graduation, Becker trained in voice-over for commercials and animation at Paul Liberti.</p><p>She went further to study film and commercial acting from Barry Shapiro and Dani Super. She also acquired improv skills at The Pit Comedy School Level 1 and Level 2. Kaitlin Becker moved to New York City, and she landed her onscreen debut in 2013 in the TV series Sunny Side Up where she portrayed the role of Kaitlin.</p><p>The series brought Becker public recognition as an actress, but that was nothing to be compared with the recognition and fame she gained following her appearance as Meekah in the 2021 TV series, Blippi’s Treehouse. Following the series, she signed a 3-year contract with Netflix that is reportedly worth millions of dollars. Some of her other notable works include Sesame Street Mecha Builders (2022) and Transformers: Rescue Bots Academy (2020).</p><p>It is therefore safe to conclude that Kaitln Becker is tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars richer than her wife, Kelly Martin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmoqtdoLKtuNhmpJqqpJ67brfAoquloZ5ir6avyp6prGWnnrOmec6rZJ2nlah6tLTEZp%2BarpVirm601KyZmqaUZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./caroline-dhavernas-hannibal-wiki-bio-husband-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Caroline Dhavernas (Hannibal) Wiki Bio, husband, net worth, family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-hall-admits-to-cheating-on-ex-mick-jagger-after-his-affair-65077.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'I Wanted Revenge'Jerry Hall Admits to Cheating on Ex Mick Jagger After He Had an Affair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
