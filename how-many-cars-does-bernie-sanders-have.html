After amassing almost $2 million in royalties from his books, he hasn’t been known to flaunt his cars.</p><p><strong>To date, Bernie has owned around six cars since his campaign for mayor in the early 1980s. In his more recent years, he’s been seen with a red Chevrolet Aveo and a green 2015-2018 model Subaru Forester. However, the exact number of cars he owns is yet to be confirmed.</strong></p><p>If his net worth has skyrocketed since his early middle-class beginnings, how has Bernie come to afford these modern eco-friendly cars? Read on to find out more about his wealth and surprising history with vehicles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sanders’ Early Days</h2><p>Born into a working-class family, Sanders showed interest in politics from a young age. <a href=# rel=noopener>An old friend of his</a>, Sandy Baird, has said that “he was always poor”, while a professor from the University of Vermont tells that he was “virtually unemployed” amid one of his political ventures in the ‘60s and ‘70s.&nbsp;</p><p>It was at this time that he <a href=# rel=noopener>didn’t have enough money</a> to pay for gas for his Volkswagen Beetle. Later, he switched to a 1967 Volkswagen Dasher, which he reportedly parked in the mayor’s spot in the early ‘80s, receiving a ticket in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>After running for mayor in 1980 and winning by 10 votes, Bernie treated himself and bought a silver Honda Civic.&nbsp;</p><p>He later came to regret that decision as he was involved in a few collisions. Previous city councilor Tom Smith stated that Bernie “didn’t care about his car” back in the day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Books, Buildings & Questions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Upon his 2016 presidential bid, the Vermont Senator’s wealth <a href=# rel=noopener>soared into the millions</a>.</p><p>His net worth could stand around $2 million, but much like his precise number of cars, a definitive answer for his fortune is unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>Book sales have been a large source of income for Sanders.&nbsp;</p><p>His first bestseller, Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In came out in November of 2016, earning him just over $800,000 in revenue. He then released Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution in 2017, boosting his income above $1 million.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He now has three houses</a>, consisting of a lakeside holiday house within the Champlain Islands of Vermont, a $489,000 row house in Washington’s capital, and a property in Burlington.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his <a href=# rel=noopener>previous disdain</a> for the flashy tendencies of millionaires, he isn’t afraid to admit his earnings from his top-selling hits. “I plead guilty to have written a book which was an international best seller” adding, “and when you write a book that makes it to the top of the New York Times bestseller list you make money. And I made money.”</p><p>Back in 2016 at the time of his presidential campaign, a photo circulated on the internet of a similar-looking man driving a luxury car worth over $170,000. This was later <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed to be false</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Electric Vehicle Advocate&nbsp;</h2><p>Bernie has never been shy about his stance on climate change. In 2019 he declared his support for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Green New Deal</a> climate plan, following <a href=# rel=noopener>his announcement</a> that he “introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in history of the United States Senate.”</p><p>He was spotted in a <a href=# rel=noopener>Lincoln Town Car SUV</a> in 2015, although it’s no surprise that the self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist he’s been seen driving several fuel efficient cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Probably his most well-known ecological car is his red 2010 Chevrolet Aveo, although it looks like he’s <a href=# rel=noopener>upgraded to a 2011 version</a>.</p><p>In March of 2020, Sanders was sighted with his Subaru Forester, <a href=# rel=noopener>accidentally locking his wife out</a> after voting on Super Tuesday.</p><p>He seems to be a fan of bumper stickers, too. His 2010 Chevy Aveo had one that said “Re-elect Bernie for US Senate 2012”, while many noticed that his Subaru has a new “Bernie 2020” to promote his late campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdlru6ecKaqaxllKSytHnBnqmnoZViwKK6w56prGWYlsOmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billionaire-michael-steinhardt-gives-up-70m-in-stolen-relics-to-authorities-is-banned-from-acquiring-antiquities-for-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billionaire Michael Steinhardt Gives Up $70M In Stolen Relics To Authorities, Is Banned From Acquiri</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alesso-bazzi-illenium-and-rae-sremmurd-to-headline-x-games-aspen-2020.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alesso, Bazzi, Illenium and Rae Sremmurd to Headline X Games Aspen 2020 Celeb Secrets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-wraps-up-in-a-black-coat-as-she-takes-her-dog-for-a-walk-around-london.html>Chloe Grace Moretz wraps up in a black coat as she takes her dog for a walk around London</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./counterfeit-html.html>Counterfeit</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-kevin-holloman-arrest-for-in-brooklyn-2020.html>What Did Kevin Holloman Arrest For In Brooklyn 2020?
