Brayden Bowers will be one of the fortunate participants who will get a k**s on the first day. Other suitors will be seen irritated with the travel nurse for bragging about k**sing Charity.</p><p>Sean, one of the suitors, admitted in a confession:</p><p>“I’m thinking, nice work. You got a k**s, but you told everyone about it. It’s insulting to the other men, in my opinion. You should get the f**k out.”</p><p>Brayden Bowers, 24, is a San Diego, California-based travel nurse. Only time will tell whether the first k**s between him and Charity will earn him the season’s first impression rose.</p><h2>Brayden Bowers works as a Licensed Practical Nurse for the United States Army.</h2><p>Brayden Bowers will be one of Charity Lawson’s suitors on The Bachelorette season 20. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is a Licensed Practical Nurse in the United States Army, where he began working in May 2017. It went on to say that he had a Biology degree from Palomar College.&nbsp;Brayden’s ABC profile discusses him in length, describing him as “hardworking and romantic” as well as “funny as he is handsome.”</p><p>“The travel nurse has big plans for the future, but he says there’s one major missing piece in his life: a wife.”</p><p>“Brayden has been in serious relationships before, but is excited about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to date Charity,” continues the profile.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Brayden-Bowers-1.jpg alt="Brayden Bowers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The bio continues:</p><p>“When Brayden loves, he loves hard, and he is willing to risk everything to find his perfect match.” Brayden hopes his future bride is honest, adventurous, and, above all, loves his puppy, River, as much as he does! Could Charity be the one Brayden (and River) have been searching for?!”</p><p>It also includes three interesting facts about him. According to the ad, Brayden is not a meditative man who appreciates a “good cigar lounge,” but rather someone who knows how to salsa dance and can teach him.</p><p>Meanwhile, he is gearing up to woo Charity Lawson in season 20 of The Bachelorette. In a sneak peek video, she asked Braydon how he was feeling during their first one-on-one.</p><p>“I’m incredible. I’m right here with you. “When I found out you were the Bachelorette, I was ecstatic,” he told Charity.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Brayden-Bowers-2.jpg alt="Brayden Bowers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Other suitors were envious and angered as the two shared their first k**s. They were angry when Brayden began boasting about the k**s to his other contenders. He declared himself to be “ready for that first impression rose.”</p><h2>Season 20 of The Bachelorette debuts on June 26.</h2><p>In addition to Brayden Bowers, Aaron Bryant, Aaron Schwartzman, Adrian, Caleb A., James, Joe, Caleb B., Christopher, Dotun, Joseph “Joey,” John., Josh, Kaleb K., Michael, John Henry, Nicholas Peter, Sean, Spencer, Tanner, Taylor, Warwick, Xavier, and Ahmad Khalid will appear on The Bachelorette season 20.&nbsp;The first episode of the new season will air on ABC on Monday, June 26, 2023, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>According to the episode’s official description:</p><p>“Charity’s quest for love begins!” Twenty-five attractive guys come, eager to make an impact on her and win her love. Later, during the cocktail party, Charity’s brother, Nehemiah, makes a bombshell revelation, and the evening takes a surprising turn. The strain is on, and every second matters, with a first impression on the table.”</p><p>The episode will also be available on Hulu the following day.
